Title: Getting more time for your projects
Lead: How to fit your gamedev hobby into your schedule?

Row Champion was supposed to be a quick, 3 months long project. It's been almost 2 years now in the making. The thing is, according to my notes, I've worked on 
it only for about 300 hours... so around 2 months of fulltime job. That difference made think about my hobby and what I want to do with that. Do I want to continue
with gamedev as a pure hobby, or do I want to go full time with it and see what the life brings?

I think doing it as a full time job someday, would be great, but quiting job without having at least one good title and with little experience in the fiels seems 
too risky. Not that I couldn't find a job quickly if I needed - IT market in Poland is booming and I belive there will be the demand for good .NET developers 
for a long time. I just think a smooth change would be a lot better - less stresful and with a bit more time to figure out the details. The most important thing
now is to get more games out build a bigger following. To do that, I need time. Between full-time job, home and family, there is just to little time left to 
do something meaningful in sensible time. 

So, the idea seems simple - I need to quit my full-time job. But then what? There are bills to be paid and you got to eat something too. 
I was thinking about doing the freelancing thing for some time already, but I was always scared a bit about the things that go around that - finding clients, 
billing and invoicing. Yeah, there are a few platforms that help you out with finding clients, but they are open for anyone and seem nasaczone of devs. Without any 
screening process, anybody can have a profile there and it's really hard for the employers to choose the right person and even harder for a dev to prove 
his experience and knowledge and land a job. I've read a few accounts from people using those sites and you have to spend a lot of time fighting for jobs
and then there are a lot of stories about delayed payments and other problems. To add to that, in Poland you have to pay some of the taxes
(VAT) as soon as you create the invoice, which sometimes mean long before getting the money. I feared that it would take all of my freed time to manage everything.

Fortunately, just recently a friend of mine recommended me Toptal. At first I thought it's just another platform for freelancers, but a quick look at their site
explains everything. Compared to the other sites, they have an interview process and hire only top 3% of the applicants. That seems tough, but in turn, they promise to 
take everything of your back to make your life easier. From finding clients, to billing and invoicing. They also offer a nice money, which I'll need to support my 
game dev adventures. I didn't need to thing about it too long and started the interview process as soon as I had some free time. Wish me luck!
