Title: Getting more time for your projects
Lead: How to fit your gamedev hobby into your schedule?

So, as my latest after-the-work project is almost done, it was time to think about what went wrong and what went great with it. I'm currently writing a post about it
so hopefully you will read it and avoid my mistakes, but today I wanted to write about that "after-the-work" thing.

Row Champion was suppose to be a quick, 3 months long project. It's been almost 2 years now in the making. The thing is, according to my notes, I've worked on 
it only for about 300 hours... so around 2 months of fulltime job. 

That's one of my biggest issues with RC. As I'm nearing the completion it was time to think about my hobby and what I want to do with that. My answer is pretty
simple - I would like to be able to do it as a full time job someday. To do that, I need to get some more games out and build a bigger following. To do that,
I need time. Between full-time job, home and family, there is just to little time left to do smoething meaning full in sensible time. 

So, the idea was simple - I need to quit my full-time job. But then what? There are rachunki to be paid etc. I was thinking about doing the freelancing
thing for some time already, but I was always scared a bit about the things that go around that - finding clients, billing and invoicing. Yeah, there are a few
platforms that help you out with finding clients, but they are open for anyone and thus nasaczone of devs. You have to spend a lot of time fighting for clients
and then there are a lot of stories about delayed payments etc. And I don;t know what is the law in your country, but it Poland you have to pay some of the taxes
(VAT) as soon as you create the invoice, sometimes long before getting the money. I didn't want that. I think I'm pretty good dev and I want to focus on that
so I can use my freed time for my projects, not for searching for the next job. 

Fortunately, just recently a friend of mine recommended me Toptal. At first I thought it's just another platform for freelancers, but a quick look at their site
wyprowadzila mnei z bledu. Compared to the other sites, they have a rigorous interview process, but in turn they take everything of your back. From 
finding clients, to billing and invoicing. They do that and you can focus on your thing. I didn't need to thing about it too long and started the process
as soon as I had some free time. Wish me luck!
