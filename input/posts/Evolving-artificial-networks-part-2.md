Title: Evolving artificial networks: Part 2

    In the part 1 I've explained some theoretical basics for ANN. In part 2 I'll show you how to create and evolve a simple NN that is able to calculate
basic logical functions like AND and OR. 

I want to start with something really simple so it's easy to understand the whole elovling ANN business.

### The neuron, the layer, the network

In part one I've explained what is a mathematical model of neuron and what are neuron layers. Let's try to put that knowledge into a code. We'll start 
with the neuron it self. It's the most important part of an ANN after all.
