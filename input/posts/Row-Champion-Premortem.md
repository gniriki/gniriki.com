Title: Row Champion Premortem
Lead: Row Champion is finally complete, so it's time to do some self-examination

It supposed to be a short, simple project. That was what I've planned, especially after my previous this-takes-so-long-that-I-already-hate-it 
adventure with Silly Ghosts. This time I had a plan and the idea seemed really good. Quick turns and clear results. 
Check. Touch control and quick and clear feedback. Check. Simple, one screen game that I can do in my free time. Check.
Small number of assets to create. Check. Nothing can go wrong. Check?

Schedule!!!

### The idea or meh idea?

It doesn't matter. It's the execution that counts the most. Thing is, blinded by the greatness of my idea, I dismissed problems with execution,
thinking that the idea will somehow overshadow those problems. When I presented my first prototype to my
friends I could see that they had a problem with getting the hang of it - some of them tried to swipe really fast and some of them had bad 
timing. I dismissed it, thinking that they just need a tutorial.

Well, the tutorial didn't help. 

### Prototype?

My main problem was that I didn't take my experience and knowledge about the game into account. Everything about touch control was clear as day for me. 
I knew how far the paddle should swing, I knew when to start the swing and I knew how to do the best swing. Others? Not so much. 
I've created the prototype, yes, but I didn't use it as I should - to test ideas and throw out the bad ones. 
Instead of thinking more about why my friends are failing, I've happily started to put hour and hours of development time into my game. 
I've finished single player mode and than showed my work to others again. And the response was meh...

### Bad game? Add features!

So what do you do when your game is failing? You add a multiplayer. I know right? Best idea ever, peoples love multiplayers. I bet everybody will play my game
in multiplayer mode when they see it. So I extended my schedule and started coding again. The main problem was, my boat code wasn;t really planned for it. 
Yeah, I could've hack it probably together, but I've decided that it's high time for rewrite. Yep, threw my tried and tested, bug free code to the trash and
have written it from the beggining. It took me around 25h. And then some more fixing bugs. Kids, don't do this at home. Anyway...

Mutliplayer is a great feature to code. I've learned a lot, really. And it took a long time... really. So after toiling away for the next 6 months of evenings,
I showed everybody my game, waiting for the world to be amazed. Well, let say the world was not amazed.

//Servers etc, money

### Fixing the design

So, now I was knee deep in my game, I couldn't just walk away. So, with the help of r/gamedev and feedback friday and starded fixing the controls and UI. 
Everytime I've changed the core design, I had to adjust multiplayer and sometimes graphics and UI. Over a few months I went through many interations like that. 
I can't image how much time I've lost reworking the same stuff over and over again. 

### The light

Finally after toiling away some more, I've started to get some positive reactions. I arrived at the very important moment, where people said - 
that's a good game or that's a bad game, instead of I don't know what's going on. Yeah, some people said it was boring or that it offered to little content, 
but that's a proper response too. Not everybody will like your game, but they should dislike it as a personal preference, not because they don' get it.

### Lessons

Do a prototype and use it properly
Create a schedule and stick to it
Don't try to hide shortcomings by adding new features, fix them
Don't use the prototype code and
Don't rewrite core code in the middle of project
Multiplayer is a great feature, but resource heavy (time, money)

### What's next

All in all I'm very happy with RC. I did some mistakes, but learned a lot. Hopefully I won't forget those lessons when I start my next project.

2. Idea - why this one, prototype, mistakes. Why trying to enhance/fix this wasn't the best idea. Costly attachment to project etc.
3. Execution - prototype was used mistake, refactoring/rewriting mistake, bad time predictions. Unity is good but bugged.
4. Mutliplayer - time sink, game took 3x more time because of it, could''ve done 2 more games... A lot of time needed for setting up everything and some money for upkeep.
5. Writer's block. Afraid of publishing/reactions
6. Conclusions; TL;DR
