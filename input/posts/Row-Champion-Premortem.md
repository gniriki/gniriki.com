Title: Row Champion Premortem
Lead: Row Champion is finally complete, so it's time to do some self-examination

It supposed to be a short, simple project. That was what I've planned, especially after my previous this-takes-so-long-that-I-already-hate-it 
adventure with Silly Ghosts. This time I had a plan and the idea seemed really good. Quick turns and clear results. 
Check. Touch control and quick and clear feedback. Check. Simple, one screen game that I can do in my free time. Check.
Small number of assets to create. Check. Nothing can go wrong. Check?

### The idea or meh idea?

I'm beginning to learn that the idea doesn't really count. It's the execution that counts. When I presented my first prototype to my
friends I could see that they had a problem with getting the hang of it - some of them tried to swipe really fast and some of them had bad 
timing. I was so sure of my idea that I had dismissed it, thinking that if they get a tutorial it will be easy to get.

Well, tutorial didn't help. 

### 

What is the difference between great and good ideas? Details. With Row Champion, there was one detail I've missed. I forgot that I had 
some experience with my game, so everything about touch control was clear for me. I knew how far the paddle should swing, I knew when to 
start the swing and I knew how to do the best swing. Others? Not so much.



2. Idea - why this one, prototype, mistakes. Why trying to enhance/fix this wasn't the best idea. Costly attachment to project etc.
3. Execution - prototype was used mistake, refactoring/rewriting mistake, bad time predictions. Unity is good but bugged.
4. Mutliplayer - time sink, game took 3x more time because of it, could''ve done 2 more games... A lot of time needed for setting up everything and some money for upkeep.
5. Writer's block. Afraid of publishing/reactions
6. Conclusions; TL;DR
