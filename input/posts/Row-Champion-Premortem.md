    It was supposed to be a 3 month project. It took more than a year.

1. Intoduction - 3 month project turned into a year, planning etc
2. Idea - why this one, prototype, mistakes. Why trying to enhance/fix this wasn't the best idea. Costly attachment to project etc.
3. Execution - prototype was used mistake, refactoring/rewriting mistake, bad time predictions. Unity is good but bugged.
4. Mutliplayer - time sink, game took 3x more time because of it, could''ve done 2 more games... A lot of time needed for setting up everything and some money for upkeep.
5. Writer's block. Afraid of publishing/reactions
6. Conclusions; TL;DR
