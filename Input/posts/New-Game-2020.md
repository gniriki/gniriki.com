Hello again everyone. Some time has passed since I've published [Row champion](/games/rowchampion) and I want to try my hand at game dev once again!

I decided to create a blog series about the progress, so I can write down my goals and thoughts and revisit them in the future. I also believe that writing them down will help me think more clearly about the design and identify good ideas and problems sooner. Finally, I hope it will be of use to other game designers.

## Goals

I've set a few goals for myself to help me focus on important stuff and not waste to much time on irrelevant things which I tend to do again and again...

### This time is all about designing fun gameplay

I haven't really thought about the design when I was working on my previous games. My first game was a match 3 game and for the second one, I borrowed game mechanics from [UGH!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugh!) without really thinking if it fits a mobile game or my theme. In my last one, I've just turned an idea, which seemed fun at the beginning, into a game, without approaching it critically.

This time I want to focus mainly on designing a fun gameplay. I know it's not everything there is to a game, but I don't want to spend a lot of time polishing a game that just isn't fun to play. 

### Small scope

This project will be done mostly in my free time, so it can't be anything too grand. I might fit a few hours here and there between my other projects, but that's not granted. I know that a tycoon game needs some depth and complexity, but I hope I can get away with minimal set of features as long as it's still fun to play.

### Iterative design and prototyping

It's really rare for the first idea to be good - it usually falls short when turned into a prototype. It happened to me before multiple times and, unfortunately, it usually took me too long to notice. I think I often fall for [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#The_fallacy_effect) and I just continue working on project even when I should stop, or at least cut it short.

This time I want to focus on prototyping and identifying bad designs early on. If a feature or mechanic is bad, I need to quickly decide if it can be fixed or it needs to be dropped like a hot coal!

### Creating the game, not the source code

Creating a game is the purpose here, not having pretty code or smart algorithms. I tend to jump into coding right away. I see a problem with code and start fixing it only to realize that it's a waste of time and the code was good enough. Other times I spend time coding some smart algorithm or idea only to realize that it doesn't affect the game that much or isn't really that important for the game. In some cases, a much simpler, abstract code that just pretends to do some smart, complex, things is more then enough.

It's not to say that I will be ok with a bad code. Poor code is hard to work with and can be as big time sinnk as trying to get a perfect code.

### Right theme for mechanics

Having right theme for the mechanics is pretty important. I made a mistake of not matching those before. [Silly Ghosts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/silly-ghosts/9nblggh0913g) used mechanics from [UGH!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugh!), where the player had to pick up cavemans from one platform and place them on the other. Kind of like caveman taxi. In Silly Ghosts the player was a taxi but for ghosts. In UGH! player could hit the caveman, who would then fall into the water and had to be rescued. Makes sense for a human. Not so much for ghosts... but it didn't occur to me until someone pointed it out in the comments!

### External resources

While it's nice to figure things by yourself, you need a lot of time to do that. With this project I'll try to learn from external sources as much as I can - podcasts, youtube and books. Whatever might help me with the game. I also would like to write down what I'm learning to remember it better.

#### Next time, I will describe what game I will be making.
