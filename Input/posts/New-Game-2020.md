Hello again everyone. Some time has passed since I've published [Row champion](/games/rowchampion) and I want to try my hand at game dev once again!

I decided to create a blog series about the progress, so I can write down my goals and thoughts and revisit them in the future. I also believe that writing them down will help me think more clearly about the desing and identify good ideas and problems sooner. Finally, I hope it will be of use to other game designers.

### Game design

I haven't really thought about the game desing when I was working on my previous games. My first game was a match 3 game and for the second one, [Silly Ghosts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/silly-ghosts/9nblggh0913g), I borrowed game mechanic from [UGH!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugh!) without really thinking if it fits a mobile game. In my last one, I've just turned an idea, which seemed fun at the beginning, into a game, without iterating on it. Additionaly, I think I might've fallen for [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#The_fallacy_effect) there and I've just continued working on it even when I should stop, or at least cut it short.

This time I want to focus mainly on designing a fun core mechanic. I know it's not everything there is to a game, but I don't want to spend a lot of time polishing a game that just isn't fun to play. 

### Project Goals

I've set a few goals for myself to help me focus on important stuff and not waste to much time on irrelevant things which I tend to do again and again...

### Small scope

This project will be done mostly in my free time, so it can't be anything too grand. I might fit a few hours here and there between my other projects, but that's not granted. I know that a tycoon game needs some depth and complexity, but I believe that a lot of features that we see in tycoons are superfluous and don't really affect the core game that much.

### Iterative design and prototyping

It's really rare for the first idea to be good - it usually falls short when turned into a prototype. It happened to me before multiple times and, unfortunately, it usually took me a long time to notice. I think it was because I spent some time on the project already and didn't want to "lose" that progress.

This time I want to focus on prototyping and identifying bad designs early on. If a feature or mechanic is bad, I need to quickly decide if it can be fixed or it needs to be dropped like a hot coal!

### Creating the game, not the source code

I need to remember that creating a game is the purpose here, not having best code or smart algorithms. It's pretty common for me to jump into coding right away. Often, I see a problem with code and start fixing it only to realize that it's a waste of time and the code was good enough. Other times I spend time coding some smart algorithm or feature only to realize that it doesn't affect the game that much or isn't really visible to the player. In cases like that, usually, a much simpler, abstract code that just pretends to do some smart things is more then enough.

It's not to say that I will be ok with a bad code. Poor code is hard to change and update and can take more time to work with down the line.

Next time, I will describe what game I will be making.
