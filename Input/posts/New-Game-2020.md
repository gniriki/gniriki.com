Hello again everyone. Some time has passed since I've published [Row champion](/games/rowchampion) and I want to try my hand at game dev once again!

I decided to create a blog series about the progress, so I can write down my goals and thoughts and revisit them in the future. I also believe that writing them down will help me think more clearly about the desing and identify good ideas and problems sooner. Finally, I hope it will be of use to other game designers.

### Game design

I haven't really thought about the game desing when I was working on my previous games. My first game was a match 3 game and for the second one, [Silly Ghosts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/silly-ghosts/9nblggh0913g), I borrowed game mechanic from [UGH!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugh!) without really thinking if it fits a mobile game. In my last one, I've just turned an idea, which seemed fun at the beginning, into a game, without iterating on it. Additionaly, I think I might've fallen for [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#The_fallacy_effect) there and I've just continued working on it even when I should stop, or at least cut it short.

This time I want to focus mainly on designing a fun core mechanic. I know it's not everything there is to a game, but I don't want to spend a lot of time polishing a game that just isn't fun to play. 

### Project Goals

I've set a few goals for myself to help me focus on important stuff and not waste to much time on irrelevant things which I tend to do again and again...

### Small scope

This project will be done mostly in my free time, so it can't be anything too grand. I might fit a few hours here and there between my other projects, but that's not granted. I know that a tycoon game needs some depth and complexity, but I believe that a lot of features that we see in tycoons are superfluous and don't really affect the core game that much.

### Iterative design and prototyping

It's really rare for the first idea to be good - it usually falls short when turned into a prototype. It happened to me before multiple times and, unfortunately, it usually took me a long time to notice. I think it was because I spent some time on the project already and didn't want to "lose" that progress.

This time I want to focus on prototyping and identifying bad designs early on. If a feature or mechanic is bad, I need to quickly decide if it can be fixed or it needs to be dropped like a hot coal!

Next time, I will describe what game I will be making.
