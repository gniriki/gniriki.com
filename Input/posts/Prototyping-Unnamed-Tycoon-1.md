Today I will go over my genre and theme choice and look at the initial prototype.

### Why a tycoon?

I've choosen tycoon genre because I like playing those games (I don't think you can create a good game if it's not a game you would like to play...) and because there is strong emphasis on the good core machanic in it. I think that a tycoon game can get away with simpler audiovisuals, provided it is fun to play, compared to an FPS or racing game. I'm a dev by trade so I hope to leverage my knowledge, instead of spending time in areas that I don't have much expertise in. There are also a lot of good games to draw inspiration from!

### Internet Co. Tycoon

This game will be about managing a company that builds networks and connects users to the internet. At least for now - as the work on prototype progresses I will try to see if the theme meches nicely with the mechanics. I can imagine that a mechanic of creating a 'network' might fit nicely here, but maybe some additional mechanics won't? Creating a 'network' might work nicely with some other themes so it wouldn't be that hard to switch if needed.
