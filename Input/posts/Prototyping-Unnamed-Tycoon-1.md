Today I will go over my genre and theme choices and lay out some basic ideas. It's time for the first prototype!

### Why a tycoon?

I've choosen tycoon genre because I like playing those games (I don't think you can create a good game if it's not a game you would like to play...) and because there is strong emphasis on the good core machanic in it. I think that a tycoon game can get away with simpler audiovisuals, provided it is fun to play, compared to an FPS or racing game. I'm a dev by trade so I hope to leverage my experience, instead of spending time in areas that I don't have much expertise in. There are also a lot of good games to draw inspiration from!

### What actually is a tycoon?

A basic business sim/tycoon game is basically a progression game. The players are given starting money which they can spend on objects which will create goods or services to be sold - the **sources** of revenue. This forms a positive feedback loop: more money -> more sources -> even more money => etc. To stop player from becoming too rich too quickly, sources usually come with some associated cost, or **sinks**. It can be as simple as an upkeep price or bit more convoluted as need of hiring workers or maintanence crew. A cost of materials or ingridients can also be added, which could scale with the business.

To make things more interesting We can add a second layer - a "map" and the building/placement mechanic. Not only player decides what sources he want to buy, but also where to place them in the game world. It can be an actual map where you place rail tracks or a restaurant where you place tables. I think that many games fail at making this part anything more than cosmetic or downright superfluous activity. The placement of sources does not affect player's revenue or costs in any meaningful way. Placement layer in a good tycoon game should offer a challenge in and of itself, independently from the sim part, but supporting it at the same time. 

Two good examples that come to mind are Railroad Empire and RollerCoaster Tycoon. In the former, the track placement affects the routes you can create and how the trains work. Failing to plan the network and juctions in a right way will cause the trains to stay in place, waiting for an empty track forever. RCT comes with a great ride building mode, that is a fun activity on it's own. Additionaly, the customers satisfaction depends on how good your ride design is. In both cases, the mechanics allow the game to be still fun and interesting in a sandbox mode - there is something to do even if you already have all the money from the beginning!

### Internet Co. Tycoon

This game will be about managing a company that builds networks and connects users to the internet. (*Just writing that down gave me some clarity!*) At least for now - as the work on prototype progresses I will try to see if the theme meshes nicely with the mechanics. I can imagine that a mechanic of creating a 'network' might fit it nicely, but maybe some additional mechanics won't? Creating a 'network' can also work with some other themes so it wouldn't be that hard to switch if needed. It could be used to create trade routes or a power grid for example.
