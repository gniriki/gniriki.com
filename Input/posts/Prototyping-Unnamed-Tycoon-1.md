Today I will go over my genre and theme choice and look at the initial prototype.

### Why Tycoon?

I've choosen tycoon genre because I like playing those games (I don't think you can create a good game if it's not a game you would like to play...) and because there is strong emphasis on the core machanic desing in it. I think that a tycoon game can get away with simpler audiovisuals, provided it is fun to play, compared to an FPS or racing game. I'm a dev by trade so I hope to leverage my knowledge, instead of spending time in areas that I don't have much expertise in. There are also a lot of good games to draw inspiration from!
